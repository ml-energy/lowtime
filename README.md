<h1 align="center">Lowtime: A Time-Cost Tradeoff Problem Solver</h1>

Lowtime is a library for solving the [time-cost tradeoff problem](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-61423-2_5).

## Where is Lowtime useful?

Say you want to execute a **DAG of tasks**, and each task has multiple execution options with **different time and cost**.

Lowtime will find the **complete time-cost Pareto frontier** of the entire DAG.

You define cost. Any floating point number that is at odds with time!


## Getting started

### Install

```console
$ pip install lowtime
```
