<h1 align="center">Lowtime: A Time-Cost Tradeoff Problem Solver</h1>

Lowtime is a library for solving the [time-cost tradeoff problem](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-61423-2_5).

## What do I use `lowtime` for?

Say you want to execute a **DAG of operations or tasks**, and each operation has multiple execution options each with **different time and cost**.

Given the definition of the DAG, `lowtime` will find the **complete time-cost Pareto frontier** of the entire DAG.

You define *cost*. Any positive floating point number that is at odds with time!
